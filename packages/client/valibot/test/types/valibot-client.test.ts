 * Type tests for @ws-kit/client/valibot

 * - Handler typing with Valibot schema inference
 * - Message payload/meta typing
 * - Discriminated union narrowing
 *
 * NOTE: These tests are currently skipped because they execute code that attempts
 * WebSocket connections, which fail in the test environment. These should be
 * refactored to be pure type-level assertions using expectTypeOf without executing
 * any code that tries to establish connections.
